# GO STUDY DERO
## Study GO using `DERO` for context 
This project takes `The Go Programming Language Specification`, found in `/references/`, and uses it as a backdrop for learning about GO. 

Much of what makes learning about `GO` tricky is that there isn't, usually, enough incentive to learn about it. 

`DERO` happens to be a cryptocurrency project that was written in `GO`. And for some, that is incentive enough to discover the tools `DERO` made using `GO`.
